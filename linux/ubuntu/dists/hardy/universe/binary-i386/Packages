 Qt's primary feature is its rich set of widgets that provides
 standard GUI functionality.
 .
 Scite is an alternative, lightweight GTK-based, Multi-language,
 Programming Editor.
 .
 Ipython is an enhanced interactive Python shell.

 Numpy is an extraordinary module which adds a fast array object
 facility to the Python language. Based on Blas and Lapack libraries,
 it is, with Scipy, the basic module for scientific work with Python.
 .
 SciPy supplements the popular Numpy module, gathering a variety of
 high level science and engineering modules.
 .
 Matplotlib is a pure Python plotting library designed to bring
 publication quality plotting to Python with a syntax
 familiar to Matlab users. It is complemented by some
 TexLive modules for labeling plots with Tex language.
 .
 ReportLab is a library that lets you directly create documents
 in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Python
 programming language.

Description: Pythonxy Development Metapackage
 This is the development package for Pythonxy.
 Aside the simple python editor Scite included in the base package,
 we provide a complete, Eclipse based environment including the 
 cdt (C/C++) and pydev (Python) pluggins. 
 This set of modules is suitable for setting up large Python applications.
 .
 Cython is a language based on the well-known Pyrex, that makes 
 writing C extensions for the Python language as easy as Python itself.
 .
 Swig is a tool to get Python bindings for your C/C++ codes.
 .
 CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be 
 used in the compiler environment of your choice. 
 You must know cmake to build your own applications based on VTK or ITK.

Description: Pythonxy Applications Package
 ITK (Insight Toolkit) is a Medical Imaging Toolkit from Kitware,
 providing enhancement of VTK libraries, whose applications can be
 useful far beyond the scope of medical imaging.
 The toolkit provides Python bindings and bridges to VTK.
 Currently under active development, ITK employs leading-edge 
 segmentation and registration algorithms in two, three, 
 and even more dimensions.
